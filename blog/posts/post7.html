        <p class="lead" style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: white; font-weight: bold;">
            Your backlog is not a roadmap. It is a graveyard of good intentions. It is where ideas go to rot, causing anxiety for your team every time they look at the ticket count.
        </p>

        <p>
            At Ronin, we have a simple rule: <strong>If a ticket is older than 90 days, it is deleted.</strong> Automatically. No review. No "saving it for later." Gone.
        </p>

        <h2>1. The Hoarding Mentality</h2>
        <p>
            Digital hoarding is real. Product Managers are terrified of forgetting a feature request, so they shove it into Jira. 
        </p>
        <p>
            "Ticket #4021: Add dark mode support to the settings dropdown." Created: Feb 2023. Status: To Do.
        </p>
        <p>
            That ticket isn't work. It's noise. It creates a false sense of debt. Your team feels like they are constantly behind, digging out of a hole that gets deeper every day.
        </p>

        <div class="stat-box">
            <span class="stat-number" style="color: #ff5f56;">2,491</span>
            <span class="stat-label">AVERAGE JIRA TICKET COUNT <br> (FOR A 10-PERSON TEAM)</span>
        </div>

        <h2>2. If It Matters, It Comes Back</h2>
        <p>
            People ask: <em>"But what if we delete a really good idea?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            If it's a good idea, it will come back. A customer will complain about it again. An engineer will bring it up again. The market will demand it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Important problems are persistent.</strong> They don't need a Jira ticket to exist. They exist in reality. If a problem is silent for 3 months, it wasn't a problem. It was a distraction.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Bankruptcy as a Strategy</h2>
        <p>
            We practice "Bug Bankruptcy" every quarter. We select all open bugs marked "Low Priority" or "Medium Priority" that haven't been touched in weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
            We hit delete. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The feeling is euphoric. The slate is clean. The team focuses on what matters <em>today</em>, not what mattered six months ago.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
            <h3>THE MENTAL COST</h3>
            <p>
                A backlog of 500 items is a cognitive load. It tells your team "You are failing." <br>
                A backlog of 10 items tells your team "This is the mission."
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>4. Jira is Compliance, Not Work</h2>
        <p>
            Jira is designed for managers who want to generate reports, not for engineers who want to ship code. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We use <strong>Linear</strong>. We keep one active cycle. If it doesn't fit in the cycle, it doesn't exist. We don't have a "Icebox." We have a trash can.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stop hoarding tickets. Start shipping features.
        </p>
